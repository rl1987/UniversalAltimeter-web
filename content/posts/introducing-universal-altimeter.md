There is certain allure that draws people to mountains. For some, it's sheer beauty of breathtaking landscapes. For others, it's the experience of overcoming difficulty and struggle when finally reaching the summit. Dangerous, yet beautiful, mountains are drawing curiosity and wanderlust for many types of people, for all of human history.

When going out on a mountain trip, knowing your current altitude is always of interest. Whether you're merely talking a walk in the mountainous terrain, going on a multi-day hiking trip, or giving it all in extreme mountain sports, knowing your elevation (height above sea level) enables you to appreciate how much you have progressed in your trip and get a feel of risk you are taking.

[Universal Altimeter](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/universal-altimeter/id1439008837?ls=1&mt=8) app turns your iPhone or iPad into barometric altimeter - no internet connection needed to measure elevation based on atmospheric pressure. You get some nice energy savings and extended battery life if you rely on barometric altimeter to know your altitude.

Mountain lovers can use our calibration settings to provide known values of atmospheric pressure, temperature and reference altitude to achieve perfect precision. We recommend to repeat calibration every few hours during your trip, or when significant changes in weather conditions happen. For your convenience, Universal Altimeter app provides a way to get these values automatically (iPhone GPS and internet access will be needed during calibration).

Furthermore, [Universal Altimeter](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/universal-altimeter/id1439008837?ls=1&mt=8) app enables you to log and graph your altitude changes over time to measure and analyse your progress.

[Universal Altimeter](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/universal-altimeter/id1439008837?ls=1&mt=8) app provides GPS altimetry as fallback. However, due to higher battery usage we recommend to use this feature only when proper calibration is not possible.

You can choose between metric and imperial units for altitude, pressure and temperature values.

We highly recommend every hiker, climber, mountaineer or anyone who visits mountains to give [Universal Altimeter](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/universal-altimeter/id1439008837?ls=1&mt=8) a try! We believe it will be useful tool that will accompany your travels.
