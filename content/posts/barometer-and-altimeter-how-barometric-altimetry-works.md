Many people are familiar with barometric altimeter - a device that measures altitude based on atmospheric pressure. But have you ever considered: what is the working principle of barometric altimeter and how does it work, really? If one has a barometer, can they use it to measure altitude? This post will hopefully make it clear and provide the knowledge for the curious.

First, let's discuss a concept of pressure. What is pressure? By definition, pressure is a force that perpendicularly affect a surface, divided by surface area. However, what we really care about here is atmospheric pressure. Atmospheric, or barometric pressure comes from gas molecules bumping into everything, thus exerting a force on any surface. Barometer is a device to measure such pressure.

Atmospheric pressure depends significantly on elevation (height above sea level) and air temperature. When elevation goes up, pressure goes down, as there is less air above the given point that is affected by gravity and pulled down. When air temperature increases, there is a drop in pressure, as air molecules have more energy for flying upwards.

Quantitively, one can use [Hypsometric Equation](http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Hypsometric_equation) to compute an elevation based on known reference values of air temperature and known atmospheric pressure at reference altitude (either at sea level or calibration location, such as hiking trailhead).

Weather greatly affects barometric pressure and resulting accuracy of altitude meter, based on such pressure. Temperature and atmospheric pressure depends greatly on movement of weather systems. Therefore, it is important to keep recalibrating your barometric altimeter in order to avoid losing accuracy. Any change in air temperature harms accuracy. Likewise, changes in air pressure harm accuracy as well.

We recommend trying [Universal Altimeter](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/universal-altimeter/id1439008837?ls=1&mt=8) app - best altimeter app that implement barometric altimeter based on iPhone sensors! It is completely free to you and provides both barometer and altimeter functionality.
